# Gunny

Gunny is an **experimental** static content generator.

Define **views** of your **data** with the aid of **templates**. Views are
defined in JavaScript, and they provide the necessary logic to filter and
transform your data before it's rendered through a template.

JavaScript parsing and execution is provided by [Boa], which currently only
implements a subset of the JavaScript programming language.

## Requirements

At present, no pre-built binaries are released, so you need to build from
source. This requires:

* Rust v1.57+

## More docs coming soon
