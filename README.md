# Gunny

Gunny is an **experimental** static content generator.

Define **views** of your **data** with the aid of **templates**, having those
views' outputs rendered to static text files.

Some uses:

- Generating configuration files
- Static web site generation

## Requirements

At present, no pre-built binaries are released, so you need to build from
source. This requires:

* Rust v1.57+

## More docs coming soon
